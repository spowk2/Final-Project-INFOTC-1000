# The beginning of your journey into the world of coding


**Tutorial created by Sean O'Connor**

### Where to start 
More often than not, people don't know where to start when they want to learn how to program. This was a struggle for myself and it kept me from learning how to program. Well, today I'm going to show you where to start and we're even going to make your first program!

### Python

To start programming we're going to use the language, Python. Why? Python is one of the simplest languages to learn seeing that it is easy to read and write. Although it is a simple language, fairly complex things can be made with Python. Web Development, Machine Learning, and even complex data analysis are all things that python is capable of doing. Of course, there are certain things that python is not the best for. That is the beauty of so many languages being available to use for different purposes!
 
### Time to download

Now, we are going to begin the downloading process for MacOS. Start by clicking this link: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
1. You're going to be taken to website that will look like this:

2. Go ahead and click on the download button at the top:

3. Now the download will start. Depending on your internet speed, the process shouldn't take too long. To check it's progress you can check the bottom left corner if you're using Google Chrome:

Or the top left corner if you're using Safari:

4. Once it has finished downloading, click on "python-3.7.3-macosx10.9.pkg". A pop-up will appear that will look like this:

5. Click continue and navigate through the rest of the steps in the window. At the end it should look like this:

6. Go ahead and click "close" and select "Move to Trash" since we won't be needing the installer anymore:

7. The installer created a "Python 3.7" folder which should be located in your Applications folder:

8. Inside of the folder click on "IDLE":

9. Great! A window that looks like this should pop up and now you can start writing code!:

## IDLE 
Before we can start writing code it's important to know that the Python shell (image from step 9)
is simply a practice window. You can write lines of code to see how they execute, however they will not be saved. In order to save the code that we write you're going to click at the top left of your screen on "File" then "New File":
<img width="900" alt="Screen Shot 2019-05-10 at 2 24 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46941500/57552923-07a08f00-7333-11e9-8d9b-209faa52aef3.png">

A blank window will pop up in which we can begin writing code in:

Since we want to save this code let's go ahead and save this program:

## First Program

Now that we can start coding we're going to make a program. Don't worry, we won't be making a game or a website. We are doing the "Hello World!" program. This program is very interesting and here's why: it's usually the first program people learn to write and it is also used by programmers to get an overall understanding of the syntax of the language in which they're writing in. Syntax is essentailly the structure or rules that a language has for how it should be written. Some languages are similar or different in syntax. For now, we are only worry about Python.

The Hello World Program goes as follows "print('Hello World'):


Once you have finsihed typing that out save the file. 

Now, at the top left hand corner of your screen click "Run" and then "Run Module":

Assuming you typed it corrrectly, a window should pop up showing your program executed!:


You're a programmer now!

## Your Journey has officially started!
Now, of course this is a simple program that isn't useful for much, but now that you know where to write code and run it you can start learning more complex programs. If you take the time to learn the concepts of a language and how the logic of a coding works you can make anything. It's important to learn at a pace you're comfortable with while still challenging yourself. Most of the time programming is about problem solving and how to do that as quickly or effieciently as possible.
