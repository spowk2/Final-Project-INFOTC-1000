# The beginning of your journey into the world of coding

### Where to start 
More often than not, people don't know where to start when they want to learn how to program. This was a struggle for myself and it kept me from learning how to program. Well, today I'm going to show you where to start and we're even going to make your first program!

### Python

To start programming we're going to use the language, Python. Why? Python is one of the simplest languages to learn seeing that it is easy to read and write. Although it is a simple language, fairly complex things can be made with Python. Web Development, Machine Learning, and even complex data analysis are all things that python is capable of doing. Of course, there are certain things that python is not the best for. That is the beauty of so many languages being available to use for different purposes!
